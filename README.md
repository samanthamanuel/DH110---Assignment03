# Assignment 03: User Research, Samantha Alexis Manuel, DH110

## Step01: Specify the research goal & requirements 

### What is the main activity your project would support for the users?
My project is meant to support users to engage with their parents, grandparents, or other family members through food connections and family history. I hope that through this project I can learn more about intergenerational and community connections through food– specifically intergenerational transmission and memory.  I wish to understand how to engage family members in the kitchen as well as the attitudes, values, and practices towards food as an important vehicle for transmitting heritage and cultural meaning. By making these connections between family members, it could benefit to understand how a user’s memory/shared family history is provoked or embodied by food. 
  

### What is the basic need/goal involved for that activity?
The activity fulfills a user’s basic need for belongingness and love (interpersonal relationships and a need for sense of belonging and acceptance among social groups) specifically through the action of communication with various types of family members. It also may fulfill physiological needs such as food being a basic essential of life to regulate the body. This sense of belonging, in this context, means being comfortable with and connection within the family that results from receiving “acceptance, respect, and love.” 

  
### What is(are) the traditional/current solution(s) to satisfy the needs?
The current solution to satisfy the need for persevering family history or recipes varies among different groups of people. Users might simply go off of oral traditions without recording them down. Other users may own a physical family recipe book which has been passed down for generations.   


### What is(are) the limitation(s) that possibly would be improved?
The current limitations to preserving family histories or recipes is having faulty memories (especially when trying to recall a dish from memory), not being able to contact/communicate with family members (whether that's due to location/time/language barriers), or sharing stories/memories associated with the recipe (typically written family cookbooks do not include a space for talking about the dish in context). These limitations can possibly be improved by providing users with the tools and accessibility to collaborate with family members on a family cookbook project or a way to easily share/access recipes across a platform. Additionally, the ability to add voice recordings, photos, or videos to one section of a recipe listed within a project would add more depth, context, and instigate connection/conversations among those with access to the project. 
## Step02: Target users 

### What are the characteristics of users? (ex. demographics, preference, expertise, mainstream vs. extreme) 
*Demographic:* Users interested in food or looking to create more connections/conversations with their family. This is someone who really cares about food, loves to eat/cook. Their family places a lot of cultural value on cooking or eating together. 

*Preference:* Users prefer spending their time with friends/family, they are interested in engaging with them through food (sharing/eating different recipes).

*Expertise:*  No expertise in cooking or archiving is necessary for them to get started, just a genuine motivation to connect with family members. 

*Mainstream vs. Extreme:* Users will be more mainstream, as in, most people have a general interest in connecting with family or a general interest in food. 


### In which context (where, why, under which conditions) would the users do that activity? 
The users are more likely to engage in this activity in the context of the kitchen or family gathering (dinners or parties). However, they are also likely to do this in their free time if they choose to use the application strictly online. Users are likely to engage with this app when they would like to record a recipe or add additional notes/memories. They also would engage with the app when searching for a recipe to cook in the kitchen or buying ingredients needed to make it.


### What would the users usually do in order to complete that activity? 
Users would use the app to begin their cookbook project. They would start a new project, invite collaborators (if needed), and begin the process of digitally transcribing a recipe. The application would integrate the use of prompts and conversation starters to add more context to building intergenerational memory transmission. These prompts would have the ability to be answered inside the application or sent (through email or text message) to other users/contributors to the cookbook project. 



## Step03: Pick an qualitative research method (or a combination/adaptation of methods)

The qualitative research methods I employed were participatory observation and ethnographic research. 

My ethnographic research method involved observing my mother and sister interacting in the kitchen while cooking a family Filipino recipe. Some of my observations include:
* Most of the cooking and passing down recipes are oral or simply through tasting throughout the whole process. 
* In addition to this, there are no measuring cups included its all by taste or proportions, it seems that the taste is up to the cook’s preference which then makes it harder to write down a single recipe
* Other than my mother teaching my sister how to cook/relaying the steps of the recipe verbally, they also had several conversations regarding how their day was or memories associated with making the dish. They even spoke about other family members and whether or not they would iterate the original recipe
* There is ultimately no reference to a physical book or copy of the recipe

I conducted participatory observation research with my sister who fits my target demographic details. Please find the materials used in the next section.

## Insights from the Interview

### How do you feel about food? Like, what is it being to you culturally? And what does it mean to you and your family?

“I love food, it's definitely something I enjoy very deeply. And in my culture, we to like, bond with other people or to like interact with other people. You're always eating a meal. Let's try it. So that is always how it is for us. And it's something I enjoy a lot. And in the kitchen, like some, like lessons I've learned from my mom is to always help out if like you're if you're in the kitchen, you're helping out. Yeah, and if you're gonna you're helping him. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. So it's always like a conscious, you always have to contribute to the meal, whether it is like cooking it or helping cook it or like setting the dining table or like washing the dishes after. And like that's what like.”

### If you had some sort of tangible recipe book or cookbook, do you think that would help you? 
10:04 to 10:23

“Personally, for me, it would definitely be helpful just because I'm not the best at cooking or remembering the recipes. But, you know, honestly, I don't think my mom would mind, my family would mind just because it's more of a way to like, share what she cooks. And it's always nice to have something like you have written down, we just never had the opportunity to write it.”

### Why are these options important to you? Or why would you think that it'd be helpful to have a template, or the ability to collaborate with other people?
16:43 to 17:00

“With like having the template or being able to collab, it would definitely make it easier being on the app, because it doesn't feel like it wouldn't feel like a project or like some sort of work. If we'd have to make the cookbook by scratch. That's why having a template and just being able to like insert photos, and have it still look like a cookbook with like other people or other members of your family also adding on to it is definitely it'd be, it'd be, like more communal and easier to navigate than the cookbook, definitely.”

### Would you be interested in that idea of sharing stories or memories associated with recipes?
19:04 to 19:26 

“Yeah, I think it's a good way to also just share your meals with your family, even if you're like, apart because my family, we all work on different time schedules, we all have different like priorities and stuff to do. So our meals are definitely scattered. And it'd be really nice to like, show what we're all eating and sharing it with each other. Maybe give each other a new recipe. And not only family, but like also friends you can share cooking with. And I think that's also why it's like it'd be really good if like, we can collaborate as well. Like, Share and share with other people. That'd be nice to have.”


## Reflection

My participatory observation session allowed me to gain more insight into the Gen Z demographic. It was enjoyable to hear more about how food relates to a person’s family and their values. I thought that the Contextual Inquiry Guide was helpful but it was even more helpful to iterate questions depending on how the subject answered. Doing that made it more personally tailored and garnered more insight. It was very helpful to understand how this specific demographic would respond to family recipes or the potential of archiving them. The participant also expressed the difficulty of remembering the details of recipes because there are no measurements or set proportions— simply estimations made by taste or eye. This made the potential of a digital cookbook an appealing solution to storing and sharing recipes among other family members. Furthermore, the idea of a digital cookbook template or something resembling a cookbook in a digital format would, according to the participant, provide feelings of familiarity and trust. It was also interesting to note that the participant also spoke about the potential of sharing recipes among friends who also have a similar priority or cultural value placed on food and family. One of the most important takeaways from this project was that the participant described the ideal cookbook as having the option to record (in photo and video) the process of cooking. Even being able to add updates or new tweaks to the recipe would speak more on the process of recipes being passed down to each generation, an iterative process changing to reflect the preferences of the person cooking it themself. Overall, this session was incredibly insightful add was a useful pairing to my ethnographic research in the kitchen.
